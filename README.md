# STM32F446RETX Microcontroller

This is firmware for the STM32-F446RETX microcontroller that is also found in Nucleo-F446RE development board. 

It reads from 8 ADC inputs, uses DMA to store the digital values into the buffer, and transfers data to PC using the USART UART bridge.

#Steps to Build and Upload Firmware

1. 
2. Upload .hex file to microcontroller by using STM32Programmer software.
